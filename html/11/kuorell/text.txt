Optical Ajustment
In my early days as a designer, I relied on Photoshop or CSS to tell me whether something was right or wrong. If Photoshop indicated that two shapes were aligned, then they were aligned. If two different shapes were the same size, then that was the case. If two colours had the same hex values, then they looked the same colour.
This approach seemed logical, but it was an incorrect way of working.
The calculations software makes are rational, but software cannot take into account the way humans perceive shape, colour, and size — that is to say the software cannot understand the context of an object in relation to other objects, in the context of an overall visual language, or how a human would perceive the object.
The irrational mind of a human needs to decide whether something looks optically correct or not, because we can see and understand a context when a computer can’t. Understanding these subtle differences and knowing how to adjust them is what makes a good designer even better — few will notice if it has been considered, but many will notice if it hasn’t.
Alignment + Visual Weight
Let’s take a look at a small number of examples of this in action.
Computers cannot figure out where the weight of an object lies in an accurate way, it can only rely on certain information such as the width, height, or x/y position. As designers, we need to compensate for this through something called optical adjustment.
The triangle in a play icon is centre-aligned in the circle right? Wrong. Drawing a rectangle around the play icon reveals that it’s off-centre.
Whilst the ‘correct’ play icon doesn’t appear off-centre, it is clear here that it is, and not just by a little bit. Why? Visual weight. The weight or mass in the triangle lies in its left-hand side, this creates an optical illusion of being off-centre even when it isn’t.
To solve this, we have to manually nudge the triangle until it appears central.
